## Overview
This is a project inspired by Yelp where users can login and browse for local
businesses. Results are gathered via the Yelp API and locations are displayed
on a map via the Google Maps API.

Once logged on users can search for specific businesses by using the header's
search bar, or search by category on the Best Of Yup page. Once a business is
found, users can navigate to the business search page to review the business, or
find business information, pictures, and reviews other users have left. They can
also view other users' profile page to see the reviews they have written or the
people they follow.
